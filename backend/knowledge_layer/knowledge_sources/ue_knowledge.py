This may initiate procedures such as handover.\n"

"

        "2. **Update Serving Cell:** The method calls `set_current_cell(target_cell)`, which updates the UE's `current_cell` attribute to the new cell and appends the cell's ID to the `serving_cell_history` list. This maintains a record of the UE's cell association over time.\n"

This clears any event trigger history, ensuring that mobility event detection (such as handover triggers) starts fresh in the new cell context."
