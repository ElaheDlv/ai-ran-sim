# AI-RAN Simulator Backend

The **AI-RAN Simulator Backend** is a Python-based simulation engine designed to model and analyze the behavior of 5G Radio Access Networks (RAN). It supports advanced features such as network slicing, mobility management, and intelligent control via xApps. This backend is part of a larger project that includes a frontend for visualization and interaction.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.12 or higher
- docker (to deploy the AI services)
- Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Start the WebSocket Server <br>Run the backend server to enable communication with the frontend:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Start the frontend <br>

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🧠 Example xApps

Example xApps are located in the `network_layer/xApps/` directory:

- Blind Handover xApp: Implements handover decisions based on RRC Event A3.
- AI service monitoring xApp: Monitors the AI service performance and provides insights.

To load custom xApps, add them to the xApps/ directory and ensure they inherit from the xAppBase class.
